# 🔧 Audio Stopping Debug Guide

## What I've Changed:
1. **Simplified distance checking** - removed throttling temporarily
2. **Added comprehensive logging** - you'll see every distance check
3. **Fixed dependency issues** - function should be called reliably

## How to Test:

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
- Press F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console tab
- Keep it open while testing

### Step 2: Test the Audio Stopping
1. Go to the green grocer (shop) 
2. Walk up to an NPC and press X to start conversation
3. **While audio is playing**, walk away from the NPC
4. Watch the console for messages like:
   ```
   🔍 Distance check: Player(500, 300) -> NPC(400, 250) = 112px, threshold: 96px
   🔇 STOPPING AUDIO: distance 112 > threshold 96
   ```

### What You Should See:
- **If working**: Distance messages appear, audio stops when distance > 96px
- **If broken**: No distance messages appear (function not being called)

### Expected Behavior:
- **Threshold**: 96 pixels (about 1.5 character widths)
- **Check frequency**: Every game frame (very responsive now)
- **Console spam**: Yes, temporarily - we'll optimize once it works

## Troubleshooting:

### If you see NO console messages:
- The function isn't being called from game loop
- Check if you're actually in the shop location

### If you see distance messages but audio doesn't stop:
- Audio system issue
- Check if `audioSystem.stopAudio()` is working

### If distance is always very small:
- Position reference issue  
- Player position not updating correctly

Let me know what you see in the console!
